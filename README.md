# **Image Comparison using CV**
**Goal**->To develop a model or use traditional computer vision techniques to detect the difference between two images and draw bounding boxes around the detected differences.

**Objective:**

*   To use any suitable computer vision technique to identify the difference between two images. 
*   The model should take two input images, identify areas with difference, and draw a bounding box around each area where it detects a difference.

*  To calculate and print a similarity score to evaluate your model.
